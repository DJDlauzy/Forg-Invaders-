Simple Frog Invaders - A Fun Browser Game!
Hey there! Welcome to Simple Frog Invaders, a super cool space shooter game you can play right in your browser! Inspired by classic arcade games, this project lets you control a cute character (like a fox or whatever you fancy!), blast waves of frog invaders, and take on a challenging boss every five levels. It’s built with p5.js for the gameplay and a touch of Tailwind CSS for styling—simple, but a blast to play!
What’s This All About?
This game is all about dodging, shooting, and having fun! You start with a little ship (or emoji character), and your mission is to fend off waves of frog aliens. Every fifth wave, a big boss shows up with its own attacks—better get those shooting skills ready! The white background keeps things clean, and the black bullets make it easy to track the action. Plus, you can tweak it to your liking!

alienEmoji: Turn the frogs 🐸 into something else (e.g., 👾, 🐍).
shieldEmoji: Change the shields 🟪 to another emoji (e.g., 🟥).
bossImageUrl: Replace the default spaceship image with your own (upload to Imgur and paste the URL).
alienSpeed, bulletSpeed, bossBulletSpeed: Adjust numbers (e.g., 1 to 5) to speed things up or slow them down.
alienCount, playerHealth, shieldHealth, bossHits: Set how many aliens appear, your health, shield durability, or boss toughness.

Feel free to experiment and share your cool creations!
Known Issues

The boss image might not load if the URL is invalid—don’t worry, it’ll fall back to a purple alien emoji 👾.
No sound yet (working on that idea for the future!).
